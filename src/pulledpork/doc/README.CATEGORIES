Readme (dot) Categories May 4, 2010 - JJC

Edited April 1, 2011 - JJC (Discussion of source)

Rule categories are prepended with VRT- or ET- based on source.  If you download
a ruleset from EmergingThreats, the category(and output file if using -k) will be
prepended with ET- and if downloaded from snort.org the same will happen but substitute
ET- with VRT-.  Lastly, if you specify a custom url to fetch the rules from, these
items will be prepended with Custom-

However, simply specifying the category without noting the source will cause modification to
ALL sources.. VRT, ET and Custom!.. i.e. specifying only "icmp".

Each respective ruleset from VRT or Emerging Threats (ET) contains categories 
that their rules belong to.  This file lists (it may not be complete)
each of these categories.  These specifications may be used in the sid
modification configuration files (enablesid, dropsid and disablesid).  
Each category is fairly self explanatory, i.e. voip contains rules pertaining 
to voip applications and exploits, whereas mysql contains rules targeted 
at detecting attacks against mysql etc....
